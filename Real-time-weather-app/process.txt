1. Create package.json file  (why do we need it?)
    npm init --yes
2. get openai sdk
    search for openai sdk for nodejs
    npm install openai  --> 
3. Generate key
   platform.openai.com 
   login
   generate key
4. Create openai client to interact with openai llm model (what's llm)
    Create index.js
    import openai from "openai"
    const OPENAI_API_KEY = ""
    const client = new OpenAI({
        apiKey : OPENAI_API_KEY
    })

5. Create tools (functions) for accessing real time data. Ususally such data comes from an api calls, here from weather api. But for now, we are just writing some hardcode functions
